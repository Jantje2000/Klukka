# Klukka
Klukka is a time registration system that you can use to check how many hours your employees worked.

You can setup this time registration system sure. You have to follow my points:

1. In the page "dbconfig.php" you have to add your own database properties. So you have to fillin your host-address, your database name, your database password and username.
2. In the page "addtime.php" you have also to add your own database properties.
3. If you want to use this system to print payslips then you have to add the API key in the page "PHPToPDF.php" on line 4. This API key could you find on <a href="https://phptopdf.com/">phptopdf.com</a>
